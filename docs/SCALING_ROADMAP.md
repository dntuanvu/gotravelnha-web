### Data Normalization

**Challenge**: Different platforms have different data formats

**Solution**: Unified schema
```typescript
interface UnifiedDeal {
  id: string
  title: string
  platform: 'trip' | 'klook' | 'attractionsg'
  category: 'hotel' | 'flight' | 'activity' | etc.
  price: number
  currency: string
  originalPrice?: number
  discount?: string
  image: string
  location: string
  description: string
  validDates: { from: Date, to: Date }
  affiliateLink: string
  metadata: any
}
```
