## Option 3: Story-Driven Approach

```
💡 From frustration to innovation...

As travelers, my team and I were tired of:
- Opening 5+ tabs to compare prices
- Missing out on exclusive promo codes
- Never knowing which platform had the best deal

So we built GoVietHub - a platform that aggregates and compares travel deals from Trip.com, Klook, and Singapore Attractions.

🎯 One search. Multiple platforms. Best prices.

We're in ALPHA and would love your feedback! Your insights will help shape the future of travel booking.

• Access exclusive promo codes and early-bird discounts
• Set price alerts for your favorite destinations
• Save time and money with one unified search

🚀 ALPHA Launch - Be among the first to experience it!

## Recommended: Option 1 (Exciting Launch Announcement)

**Why this works:**
- Clear value proposition upfront
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Creates FOMO with "alpha/early access" angle
- Strong call-to-action
- Relevant hashtags for discoverability

**Before posting:**
1. Replace `[Your Website URL]` with your actual website URL
2. Add 1-2 images (screenshot of homepage or key features)
3. Consider adding a comment with a pinned link in the first comment
4. Tag relevant people/organizations if appropriate

**Posting Tips:**
- Post on Tuesday-Thursday between 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM for best engagement
- Respond to all comments within the first hour
- Pin a comment with your website link for easy access
- Use 3-5 hashtags for optimal reach (LinkedIn limits effectiveness of too many)
